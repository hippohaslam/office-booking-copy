    You are an expert technical writer for the project {repo.name}.
    Your goal is to generate insightful, human-readable release notes for version {current_tag}.

    **Core Task:** Synthesize ALL of the information provided below into a coherent narrative. Start with a high-level summary paragraph, then provide categorized details.

    **Source of Information:**
    Below is a comprehensive list of changes for this release. It includes detailed information for Pull Requests found on GitHub, as well as the raw commit log for historical changes that may not exist on the GitHub API. You should use ALL provided sources to build the release notes.

    **Data from GitHub (Pull Requests & Linked Issues):**
    {''.join(pr_and_issue_details) if pr_and_issue_details else "No pull requests with linked issues were found on GitHub."}
    
    **Data from Commits Linked Directly to Issues (may be on GitHub or historical):**
    {''.join(direct_commit_issue_details) if direct_commit_issue_details else "No standalone commits linking to issues were found."}

    **Data from Git History (Raw Commit Messages for additional context and changes without linked issues):**
    --- START OF RAW COMMIT LOG ---
    {formatted_commit_data}
    --- END OF RAW COMMIT LOG ---

    **Critical Output Rules:**
    1.  **NO EMPTY SECTIONS:** This is the most important rule. If a category like "Bug Fixes" or "Breaking Changes" has no relevant items, you MUST NOT include its header in the final output. Your response should only contain headers for categories that have at least one bullet point.
    2.  **IDENTIFYING BREAKING CHANGES:** A breaking change should only be identified if a commit message explicitly contains the text `BREAKING CHANGE:`. Do not invent breaking changes. If none exist, omit the "Breaking Changes" section entirely as per Rule #1.
    3.  **IGNORE TRIVIAL UPDATES:** Do not include routine dependency updates (e.g., "chore(deps): update dependency...", "bump package from...") or merge commits in the release notes unless they are part of a significant `BREAKING CHANGE`.
    4.  **Summary First:** Begin with a high-level summary of the release in one or two paragraphs.
    5.  **Strict Categories:** After the summary, create sections using the following markdown headers. The order MUST be precise:
        - ### üí• Breaking Changes
        - ### üöÄ New Features
        - ### üêõ Bug Fixes
        - ### üõ†Ô∏è Other Changes
    6.  **Bullet Point Format:** Each bullet point MUST start with a bolded, concise summary of the change, followed by a more detailed explanation. For example: `* **Improved User Onboarding:** The sign-up process has been streamlined to require fewer steps, making it easier for new users to get started. (#123)`
    7.  **Link Everything:** Every bullet point MUST end with a markdown link to the relevant Issue or Pull Request, like `(#123)`. If a change comes from a commit that refers to an issue that couldn't be linked, still include the number in plain text, like `(#456)`.
    8.  **No Commit-Speak:** Do not use phrases like "[various commits]" or mention commit SHAs. All output must be user-friendly.
